### My 3 elements

##### Element 2: Using **SSH** with **SECRETS**

##### Element 3: Web Server **NGINX**
As provided in earlier exercise I've used the Web server ***NGINX***.

This makes printing ***tables*** easy and improves readability.  
* The color of the values is the color *cyan* because I think this is easy on the eyes.
* The headers are kept the color *white* so they stand out against the black background.
* The background is purposely not changed, because, in my eyes, a command line interface should stay as-is: mostly color *black*.

Also this module is used for other ***printed output***.  
* Every correct output is in the color *green*.
* Every error output is in the color *red*.
